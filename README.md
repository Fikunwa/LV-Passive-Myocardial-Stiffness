Summary: Framework for MRI-driven passive myocardial stiffness estimation using left ventricles. The framework uses cDTI to define local fiber orientations, tagged MRI for the local kinematics, and cine bSSFP MRI for the surface geometry

The optimization was done in MATLAB, with FEBio (https://febio.org/downloads/) as the forward solver. 
Of note, you also need to install the Gibbon toolbox on MATLAB (https://www.gibboncode.org/), and may need other MATLAB toolboxes. 
If there is any issue with running the code, please reach out to author â€“ Fikunwa Kolawole at fikunwa@stanford.edu
